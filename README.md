## ⚠️ Note on Blind SQL Injection Labs

I have completed the theoretical understanding and challenge of Blind SQL Injection, covering:

- Boolean-based blind SQLi

- Error-based blind SQLi

- Time-based blind SQLi

- Out-of-band (OAST) techniques

Labs requiring Burp Suite or other advanced proxy tools were skipped due to tooling constraints. However, the concepts and payloads have been thoroughly studied and understood.
