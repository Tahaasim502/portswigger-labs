## 🧠 Web Security Academy Labs – PortSwigger

Welcome to my Web Security Academy practice repository!

This is where I document my journey in learning web application security through hands-on labs provided by PortSwigger.

## 🚀 About the Project

This repository includes:

✅ Solved labs with explanations

📝 Writeups in my own words

🔎 Vulnerability examples (like SQLi, XSS, etc.)

🔐 My progress in learning offensive & defensive security skills

## ⚠️ Note on Blind SQL Injection Labs

I have completed the theoretical understanding and challenge of Blind SQL Injection, covering:

- Boolean-based blind SQLi

- Error-based blind SQLi

- Time-based blind SQLi

- Out-of-band (OAST) techniques

Labs requiring Burp Suite or other advanced proxy tools were skipped due to tooling constraints. However, the concepts and payloads have been thoroughly studied and understood.

## 🚪 Path Traversal Vulnerabilities

Path Traversal is a critical web vulnerability that allows attackers to access sensitive files and directories on a server by manipulating file path parameters.

Key learning highlights:

- Understanding how ../ sequences enable directory traversal

- Exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities using only browser tools

- Advanced bypass techniques:

  - Nested traversal sequences (....//, ....\/)
  - 
  -URL encoding and double URL encoding of traversal payloads

- Common obstacles and how filters can be circumvented

- Practical prevention strategies: input validation, safe file handling, and server configuration

This topic was explored deeply with hands-on labs and real-world examples to build solid foundational knowledge.

# ✅ Finished Labs

- Basic SQL Injection

- Blind SQL Injection (theory & challenges, without Burp Suite)

- Path Traversal (hands-on with browser-only tools)
