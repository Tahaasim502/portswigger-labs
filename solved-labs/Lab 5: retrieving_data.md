# Lab 5: SQL Injection â€” Retrieving Data Using UNION Attack

## Lab Overview

This lab demonstrates how to use a UNION-based SQL injection to retrieve data from other tables in the database, such as usernames or email addresses.

---

## Key Concepts Learned

- UNION can combine results from the original query with attacker-supplied data.

- Requires matching the number and type of columns.

- Helps retrieve sensitive data (e.g., from users table).

- Must display text through a visible column.
